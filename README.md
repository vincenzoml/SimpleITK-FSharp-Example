# SimpleITK dotnet quickstart

A simple project to start developing applications using SimpleITK in CSharp or FSharp.

Just clone the repository, copy the fsharp or csharp project, run "dotnet build" once, in order to download simpleitk. 

Check the fsproj or csproj to change SimpleITK version, and see how it works. 

*Happy hacking!*

NOTE: this project is still in pre-alpha. Any patch accepted. Help with turning the downloaded library into a nuget package, much appreciated. Open an issue for any question.
